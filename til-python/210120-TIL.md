## Lessons
Today's lessons consisted of introducing Group Objects present in Python as well as experimenting on how to use them.

## Group Objects
- List
- Tuples
- Dictionaries

### List
```
animals = ['','','']
```
Lists use **square brackets**.
Lists are mutable in the sense that they add and remove elements inside.
```
lang = []
lang.append("python") 
lang.append("java") 
lang.append("golang")
print(lang) -----> lang = ["python", "java", "golang"]

//Use insert to add an element at a specified index location
lang.insert(1, "c")

//Remove elements with various methods
lang.remove("golang")

//Or select elements that you want to pop out
java = lang.pop(2)
```

Lists can also be sorted wit ".sort()"
```
numbers = [2, 1, 4, 3]

numbers.sort()
print(numbers) ---> [1, 2, 3, 4]

numbers.reverse()
print numbers --> [4, 3, 2, 1]
OR
numbers.sort(reverse=True) --> sorts in reverse order
```

Concat (add) lists with each other using extend

```
numbers = [2, 1, 4, 3]

numbers += [5, 6]
numbers.extend ([7, 8])
print(numbers.sort()) --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

### Tuples
```
 animals = ('','','')
```
Tuples use **round brackets**.

Tuples are **immutable**, meaning elements cannot be added or removed once inside a tuple. However, tuples can be added with each other or repeated.
```
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
tuple2 = (5, 6)

print (tuple1 + tuple2) --> (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

print (tuple2 * 2) --> (5, 6, 5, 6)
```

How to switch the values around using tuples:
```
//originally to make: x = y AND y = x:

temp = x
x = y
y = temp

//but with tuples:
(x, y) = (y, x)
```

Lists and Tuples can be **typecasted** into each other!

```
list ((1, 2)) --> makes tuple into list
tuple([1, 2]) --> makes list into tuple
```


### Dictionary, Set

Dictionaries are a grouping object binds data by mapping them. 

Compared to Lists and Tuples, they do not have an index. Rather, the data is comprised of keys and value pairs.

To create a dictionary:
```
dict1 = {} --> empty dictionary

//to add elements to a dictionary
 dict1 = {'name': 'foo bar'} --> as it is created
 dict1 = {'korean': 95, 'math': 100, 'science': [80, 70, 90, 60]} --> can contain group objects as its value
 dict1['english'] = "pass" --> assigining a key and value manually


//To delete elements
 del dict1['math']

//To get its value using its key
 print(dict1['korean'])

//To only print its keys
 print(dict1.keys())

//To only print its values
 print(dict1.values())

//To print both keys and values
 print(dict1.items())


//Pop an element
 dict1.pop('english')

//pop both key and value pair
 dict1.popitem('science')

```



Using Dictionary with string Formating


```
contacts = {'name':'Guido', 'country':'Netherland'}
"{name} is born in {country}".format(**contacts)--> **contacts is used to 'open' the group object to make it accessible
```

## Questions
### Q.
**In Python, is string an actual data type? Why doesn't Python have a character data type as in C while it behaves like it does (strings can be indexed as if it were an array of characters)?**

### Q.
**What is a hash tble and how does it work?**



## To Do
- Look up the official documentaiton of the functions and methods learned in class to learn more about their syntax, parameters, positional arguments,named arguments, and so on.
- Look up hash tables, hash
