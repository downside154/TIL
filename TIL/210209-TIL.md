<h2> 1. HackerRank Class 2 "Find the Torsional Angle" Exercise </h2>

Given: You are given four points A, B, C, and D in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. You are required to print the angle between the plane made by the points ABC and BCD in degrees. Let the ange be PHI. 
cos(PHI) = (X.Y)/|X||Y| where X = AB x BC and Y = BC x CD. 
X.Y is the dot product of X and Y, while AB x BC means the cross product of vectors AB and BC. Also, AB = B - A.

Find PHI.

<h2> 2.Subway Question</h2>

Create a class system for a subway train.

Assumption: various data that is necessary to operate the subway train appropiatel (such as the location, speed and proximity of the next train, route, which door to open according to the route and so on) is stored and retrieved from a central network


Route: 내선순환, 외선순환, 성수지선, 신도림지선
Characteristic: line2, route, distance from next train
Method: Accelerate/Decelerate. Open/Close doors
