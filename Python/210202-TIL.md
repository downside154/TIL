## Review:
- List Comprehension (Hackkerrank)
- Converting CSV Files to JSON

## Learned:
- Error Handle(Try, Except, Else, Finally)
- Regular Expressions
- Lambda functions/ mapping, filter, reduce

## Questions:
- Look up other Error Handle 
- What exactly is regular expressions? why does it need to be imported. What does the import code do exactly?

## TODO:
- Create new JSON file from a CSV file
- Try 30 days of code problems in hackerrank
- Research RegEx meta characters
- Research Lambda functions, look up how memory is stored
