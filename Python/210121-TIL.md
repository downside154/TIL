## Lessons
Today's lessons consisted of introducing Conditional Statements (if, else, elif, for, while) in Python as well as some practical exercises to familiarize their usage with practice.

## Conditional Statements

Syntax to use Conditional Statements in Python:

**If, Else, Elif(else: if:)**
```
if condition1:
>>>>expression1

elif condition2:
>>>>expression2

elif condition3:
>>>>expression3
..
..
else:
>>>>expression n
```

### numguess
import random to get and use randomized integers.
```
import random

answer = random.randint(1,100) --> a random number from 1 to 100
```



### Ternary Operators

**단항연산자**
부호 (+, -), not
- +3, -0.2, not True, etc...

**이항연산자**
대부분의 연산자
- 3 + 1, 2 * 3.14

**Conditional Expressions inside Conditional Expressions**

**a** if **condition** else **b** if **condition** else **c**
is equivalent to
```
if condition:
        result = 'a'
else:
        if condition:
                result = 'b'
        else:
result = 'c'

```

Conditional Expressions have the lowest priority among Python's operatos.

### Loops using For, While

Example of For:

```
sum = 0
for i in range(1,11):
        sum += i
    sum = sum + i
print(sum)
```

Example of While:

```
while name != "foo bar":
        name = input("What's your name? ")
        print("Hi, " + name + "So, where is foo bar?")
```


### Dictionary with Iterations


```
a_words = []
with open('./a_word_list.txt') as f:
        textlines = f.readlines()
        for item in textlines:
        a_words.append(item.replace('\n',''))
```



### Iterations with Conditional Statements

```
num = eval(input("type the number: "))
for i in range(1, num + 1):
        if i % 15 == 0:
                print("fizzbuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
                print("fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
                print("buzz")
        else:
                print(i)
```

Example of a random integer guessing with tries counted:
```
import random
answer = random.randint(1,100)
username = input("Hi there, What's your name?? ")
trial = 5
while trial:
    guess = eval(input("Hi, "+ username + ". guess the number: "))
    if guess == answer:
        print("Correct! The answer was ", str(answer))
        break
    elif guess > answer:
        trial -= 1
        print("Too high!! Try again!!(%d times left)" % (trial))
    elif guess < answer:
        trial -= 1
        print("Too Low!! Try again!!(%d times left)" % (trial))
if trial == 0:
    print("You are Wrong! The answer was ", str(answer))

```

### Q.
**How does prioritization matter in ternary operators?**



## To Do
- Look up the official documentaiton numguess, especially on how its inner workings operate to create a random integer. Also see the documentation on its possible usages and potential parameters.
- Look up documentation on iterations and loops
