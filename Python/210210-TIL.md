## Lessons
Today begun our lesson on Classes on Python, along with an introduction of OOP

**Summary**
1. Classes
2. Instances
3. Static Method
4. OOP --> programming paradigm



## Methods:

**Class Method:** Uses *@classmethod* to recieve class parameters and variables
**Instance Method:** uses *self* parameter. Uses the inherent properties of the object/instance.
**Static Method:** does not use any parameteres. Uses the same property as a function. Used when a function correlated with a class needs to be defined.

### Method Example:
```
class Wallet:
    def __init__(self, account):
        self.account = account
    balance = 0
    name = 'Your wallet'
    @classmethod
    def set_default(cls, amount):
        while amount < 1:
            print("Err: You should set default value over 1. Try again!")
            amount = int(input("Set default value: "))
        cls.balance = amount
        print('Set default balance to {}'.format(amount))
    #instance method
    def add_to_account(self, amount):
        self.account += amount
        print('Your total balance is {}'.format(self.account + Wallet.balance))
    @staticmethod
    def see_static_name():
        print(Wallet.name)
    def get_class_name(cls):
        print(cls.name)
class MyWallet(Wallet):
    name = 'My wallet'
```

### Polymorphism
Plymorphism referes to how different class objects that inherit the same model can create different return values accordingly.

In the example below, the abstract class SmartPhone will inherit its properties to both the class IPhone and class Galaxy below. However, their methods will replace the inherited values to respond differently.
```
class SmartPhone:
    def get_ap(self):
        print('Application Proccessor')
class IPhone(SmartPhone):
    def get_ap(self):
        print('A series')
class Galaxy(SmartPhone):
    def get_ap(self):
        print('Exynos')
```

### Abstract Base Class 
- Creates a parent class that has all the common properties, while preventing the class to prevent the creation of Object instance
- It creates an Abstract Class so that it cannot retain its properties on its own.
**review and add to this later!!!!**

```
from abc import *
class SmartPhone(metaclass = ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_ap(self):
        pass
...
```

### Module & Package:
- Module: a lower level than its body. File with code created with python.
**review later, esp Modular Programming**
- Package: a bundle of modues that are co-related

*Example of a package to find fibonacci sequence:*
3 different modules, in 1 package to print a number using the Fibonnaci sequence.
```
# fibos/fibo.py
def fibo(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)

# fibos/binet.py
from math import sqrt
def binet(n):
    return int(((1+sqrt(5))**n - (1-sqrt(5))**n) / (2**n*sqrt(5)))

# print_something.py
print('something')
```

```
#from fibos import fibo
#from fibos import binet as bn
#from fibos import fibo, binet
#from fibos import *
#import print_something
#from . import print_something
```

### Library & Framework
**Library(jQuery, http):**
- A collection of functions and actions
- Python's standard library: print + C module(OS), python modules(math)
- you are in control as you call the library

```
math.pi
```

**Framework(React, django):**
- Creates an abstraction of classes and components to use
- Framework is in control as it calls you

```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def get_index():
    return 'this is home'
```

### Poetry
Poetry is a Python Packaging and dependency manager.

for pyenv
```
# pyenv PATH
export PYENV_PATH=$HOME/.pyenv
if which pyenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv init -)"; fi
if which pyenv-virtualenv-init > /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"; fi
# poetry PATH pyenv PATH export PATH=$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH
```

Commands:
```
# initialize
$ poetry init
# add package
$ poetry add <package name>
# remove package
$ poetry remove <package name>
# show installed package
$ poetry show --no-dev --tree
# export package list to requirements.txt
$ poetry export -f requirements.txt > requirements.txt
```

## Questions
### Q.
**What are the differences between various frameworks and why do they differ in usages and popularity? Look in depth into their functionality as well as their pros and cons**
  


## To Do
- Find more data on pyenv
- Learn more on classes and instances, especially on how it manipulates data upon construction and how they are called back
- Learn more about 'self' callback feature.
